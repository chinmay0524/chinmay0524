## 🌌 **About Me**

I am **Chinmay Sharma**, a Data and AI Analytics professional whose journey combines analytical experience, practical resilience, and steady upskilling. After relocating to the UK in **2021**, I took on different roles while adapting to a new chapter of life. Those years strengthened my discipline and helped me stay focused on long-term goals, even when the path was not linear.

After rebuilding my technical foundation in **2024**, by completing a Data Analytics Bootcamp, I am deepening my capabilities through an **AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp**, where I am getting hands-on experience in model development, deep learning, NLP and responsible AI practices.

Earlier in my career, as a Research Analyst for European telecom markets, I learned to approach data with clarity, patience, and attention to detail — habits that still guide my work.

My work centres on bringing order to complexity—clean code, thoughtful models, and well-structured analytical workflows that support clear decisions.
